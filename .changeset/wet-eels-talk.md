chore: migrate from npm to pnpm and changesets

Migrates the project from npm to pnpm and implements changesets for automated releases.  This improves dependency management, reduces install times, and streamlines the release process.  Adds support for environment variables for server configuration.  Includes updates to CI workflows for integration and deployment with pnpm and changesets.  Adds type definitions for environment variables and improves code structure with new files and types.  Also includes a sanity test and linting in the CI workflow.
